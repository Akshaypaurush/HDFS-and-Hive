# HDFS-and-Hive

# Description of Project

For this Big-data project, I took the web-series data from Kaggle website, and converted that data into CSV file. The dataset contains 9 columns and 12500 rows approximately. Then using Ambari I imported the CSV file data into HDFS. After that I created one database and table inside that database using Hive. Then I  loaded the web-series data into the Hive table and finally did some analysis on that dataset with the help of Hive queries. And also stored the output of Hive queries back into HDFS.

# Objective

The objective is to analysis the web-series data and also  used that dataset to answer the following questions:
* Which streaming platform(s) can I find this web series on?
* Average IMDb rating and other ratings
* What is the genre of the title?
* What is the synopsis?
* How many seasons are there right now?
* Which year this was produced?
* For which age group this web-series is appropriate.

# Technologies Used

HDFS:  for storing large web-series dataset and provides easier access to hive tables.

Hive: Hive is used  to facilitates easy data summarization, ad-hoc queries, and the analysis of web-seires datasets stored in Hadoop compatible file systems.
